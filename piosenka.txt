Rainbow colours cross the sky
To find a pot of gold
Voices cry follow deep down in my soul
Down in my soul
Unresponsive like a rock
My eyes are sad and grim
Wonderin’ what she is
Doin’ with him
Doin’ with him.

Broken hearts can turn to stone
I feel apart when left alone
Broken hearts can turn to stone
When left alone, I am alone.

On the sidewalk yesterday
I saw her passing by
I wanted to cry out – How could you, why
How could you, why
I hope her new love understands
And takes good care of her
Chasin’ that rainbow, holdin’ my girl
Holdin’ my girl.

Broken hearts can turn to stone
I feel apart when left alone
Broken hearts can turn to stone
When left alone, I am alone.
